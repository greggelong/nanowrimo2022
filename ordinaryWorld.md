## The Ordinary 
Gerg is 12 years old. The United States were he lives is 204 years old. From these pieces of information and some basic knowledge of US history (ie that it was founded in 1776) you the reader can probably do a quick calculation in your head to arrive at the fact that the year is 1980 and Gerg was born in 1968. However if you could not do this calculation in your head, but instead counted on your fingers, scratched on some paper, or flubbed the calculation entirely, take heart you are very much like Gerg.  
Gerg's math scores are pretty poor. He is nervous approaching a test, and has trouble concentrating once that anxiety has crept in. Gerg does in fact like math, at least the concepts.  He like many children love the concept of infinity as the ultimate secret weapon
